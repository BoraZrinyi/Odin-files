<!-- Simple link with a:b -->
<p>
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" >Same Link, but target is _blank.</a></p>
<p>While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank as follows:</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Same link, but  target is blank, rel is  nooperner noreferrer</a>
</p>

<p>
    The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.

    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.   
<p></p>   
     Why do we need this added behaviour for opening links in new     tabs? Security reasons. The prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.
<p></p>
    Note that you may be fine if you forget to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent versions of browsers provide security if only target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".</p>

   <!-- Absolute links -->
<p><h2>Absolute links</h2>
    Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: scheme://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.
    
    We’ve already seen an absolute link in action. The link we created to The Odin Project’s About page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the scheme and domain:</p>
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>

<p>
 <!-- Relative links -->
<h2>    Relative links</h2>    
Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
